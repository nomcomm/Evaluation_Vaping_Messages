    "# Step 3: Generate Vaping Messages via Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "## by: Sue Lim\n",
    "\n",
    "Before reaching this notebook, I completed the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decided vaping as a health topic\n",
    "2. Scrapped vaping prevention messages via SNScrape\n",
    "3. Selected 15 appropriate messages (ranked by retweetCount)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I generated messages via Bloom, a language model driven by Transformer neural network technology. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used Google Colab Pro+ acocunt to generate these messages because of the extra Ram stroage that comes with Google Colab Pro+ account. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, You **DO NOT** need Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), special technology available on Google Colab to use the Bloom language model. You can run the model on your own computer if you would like. That is the **BENEFIT** of using the Bloom language model. "

      "0: Nicotine in vapes is the most common chemical to be found in a vaping liquid. A variety of different nicotine strengths are available in the vape juice market, from low strengths to very high strengths. The lower strengths are often referred to as being “low nicotine” or “nicotine free”\n",
      "1: Nicotine in vapes and cigars is a highly addictive drug. However, the nicotine content of e-cigarettes is much lower than the nicotine content of traditional cigarettes. It is estimated that the nicotine content of a typical e-cigarette is only about 10 to 20 percent of that\n",
